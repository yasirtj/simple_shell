		<h4>Project Description</h4>
		<p>Simple shell is a group project at ALX SE aimed to write a simple and customized command interpreter.
  	It is designed to mimic sh and provides an interface between the user and the kernel by executing commands.
		</p>
		<h4>Learning objectives</h4>
			<p>At the end of this project, learners are expected be able to explain to anyone</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How does the shell works</li>
			<li>What is pid and ppid</li>
			<li>How to manipulate the environment of the current process</li>
			<li>What is the difference between a function and a system call</li>
			<li>How to create processes</li>
			<li>What are the three prototypes of main</li>
			<li>How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs</li>
			<li>How to execute another program with the execve system call</li>
			<li>How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates</li>
			<li>What is EOF / “end-of-file”?</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Compilation</h4>
		<p>The code should be compled this way:</p>
		<p>$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh</p>
		<h4>Tasks</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>All codes should pass betty style check</li>
			<li>A Unix command line interpreter</li>
			<li>Handling command line with arguments</li>
			<li>Handling the PATH</li>
			<li>Implementing the exit built-in, that exits the shell</li>
